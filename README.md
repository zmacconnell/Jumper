# Jumper
Save the jumper before it's too late! <i>Jumper</i> provides a 
guesswork expereince through trial and error. But be careful, 
too many wrong guesses will lead to his demise. The rules are 
simple, very similar to hangman, if you get it right the letters
show up on the line. Get it wrong, and you lose one part of the 
parachute.
